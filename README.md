Considerable effort is needed to describe the many aspects of fluid motion.
Even more effort is needed for animating fluids in real-time.

Here, I put together a fluid simulator which is based on the classic [Stable Fluids](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/stam/reality/Research/pdf/GDC03.pdf)
algorithm on solving the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flow by Jos Stam [1].
The graphics framework for this simulator is based on the [LearnOpenGL Breakout tutorial](https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/2D-Game/Breakout).
